# Team Vacation Calendar App Script

This solution uses Google Apps Script to automatically populate a shared vacation calendar based on the individual calendars of each person on the team. When someone books time off they just need to remember to add an event to their personal Google Calendar using a keyword like "Vacation" or "Out of office." The script acts behind the scenes, scanning the calendars of all the members in a Google Group and syncing appropriate events to the shared calendar.

More information on how this script works can be found here: https://github.com/googleworkspace/solutions/tree/master/vacation-calendar

P.S : For the script to work you will need to add the Google Calendar API (Under "Services" on the App Script editor).
